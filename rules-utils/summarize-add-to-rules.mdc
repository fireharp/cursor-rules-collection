Let's review our conversation.

Let's review our current rules.

Do you think anything would make sence to add to our ruleset?
- related to programming language usage / setup / best practice
- related to frameworks usage / setup / best practice
- related to what user likes / doesn't like in general

It's highly likely that this conversation was related to specific problem, but sometimes in 5% of cases we may generalize onto those categorize and suggest adding some rule.

If so â€“ suggest a new rule.
You may check existing ones in .cursor/rules and make a similar.
