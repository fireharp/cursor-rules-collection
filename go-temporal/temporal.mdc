Temporal solves many problems that developers face while building distributed applications. But most of them revolve around these three themes:

- Reliable distributed applications
- Productive development paradigms and code structure
- Visible distributed application state

# Reliable execution
How does Temporal make applications reliable?

Temporal makes it easier for developers to build and operate reliable, scalable applications without sacrificing productivity. The design of the system ensures that, once started, an application's main function executes to completion, whether that takes minutes, hours, days, weeks, or even years. Temporal calls this Durable Execution.

# Code structure
How does Temporal simplify application code for software developers?

By shifting the burden of failure handling from the application to the platform, there is less code for application developers to write, test, and maintain. Temporal's programming model offers developers a way to express their business logic into coherent Workflows that are much easier to develop than distributed code bases.

Choose the SDK that best suits your preferred programming language and start writing your business logic. Integrate your favorite IDE, libraries, and tools into your development process. Temporal also supports polyglot and idiomatic programming - which enables developers to leverage the strengths of various programming languages and integrate Temporal into existing codebases. Developers achieve all of this without having to manage queues or complex state machines.

# State visibility
How does Temporal make it easier to view the state of the application?

Temporal provides out-of-the-box tooling that enables developers to see the state of their applications whenever they need to. The Temporal CLI allows developers to manage, monitor, and debug Temporal applications effectively. The browser-based Web UI lets you to quickly isolate, debug, and resolve production problems.

# Docs
For any questions or clarifications regarding the implementation or usage
of the TemporalIO library, please refer to the documentation available in
the 'docs/temporal-go-sdk' folder @temporal-go-sdk 
 at the root of this project.

To access the documentation:

- Open the 'docs/temporal-go-sdk' @temporal-go-sdk  folder.
- Navigate to the relevant section based on your query.

Ensure that you consult this documentation to maintain consistency and
adhere to best practices when working with TemporalIO components.
