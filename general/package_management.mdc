!NEVER! update package.json, go.mod, pyproject.toml, requirements.txt dependencies manually, always use appropriate package manager: `npm`, `pnpm`, `yarn`, `go mod`, `uv`, `uv pip`, `poetry` or else depending on the project

Same goes to other package based dependencies.

When possible.

Sometimes in rare occasions you may edit dependencies in files manually â€“ then outline this! And explain why you had no other choice and didn't use package manager for it.
