When working with `task check` and `task lint`, especially in test files, handle linter issues appropriately:

- ✅ **Use no-lint tags** when linter warnings are not relevant to test logic.
- ✅ **Fix issues** where possible to maintain clean and maintainable code.
- ❌ **Don't ignore critical warnings** that could impact test correctness.

Example (Applying No-Lint Tags in Go):
```go
//nolint:errcheck // This is fine in tests where error handling is not critical
someFunctionThatReturnsError()
```

Ensure that any suppressed linter rules are justified and do not compromise test reliability.
